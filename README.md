Game Tips:
To start the first round in the game, pick up the flashlight on the ground in the starting room.

The yellow cylinder in the starting room is an ammo buy station, it partially fills your currently equipped weapon with more ammo.

To switch between weapons, use the scroll wheel or press 1, 2, 3, and 4. You start out with a pistol and shotgun.

The colored boxes around the map are perk machines. The green one increases movement speed, the red increases max health, and the purple increases your damage.

Make your way to the power room, look for the white cube on the wall and interact with it. Survive.
